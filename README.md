## Introduce myself to you: 
I am a senior student majoring in biology. Among fields in life science, I am interested in bioinformatics most, and last year I finished a simple project, a research about alternative splicing in rice, using some techniques of bioinformatics. I plan to do some reseaches about cancer in future. Just like many other college students, in my spare time, I like to browse the website of [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) and watch some videos on it. I like some good animations. For example, Clannad, Angel Beats, and Steins Gate.  



## This is an uncompleted small project.
>   Have you ever dreamt of creating lives on your computer? I tried a few months ago, just for fun, using my favorite programing language C. I built a  matrix, and let a kind of "grass" grow and multiply in it. The grass can produce seeds and the seeds will be spread every generation. The grass has its age, height and other features, which can be recorded in "genes". and there are interactions between them. What's the most important is that the genes have mutations. I wanted to see if they can develope to new "species" and how the population changes, and how the interations between "genes" change. I started from just one type of "grass" and some basic features and I planned a huge project, which includes various animals, plants, types of "genes" as well as notions such as " hybridize" and "adaptation"(Measured according to the similarity between "DNA" and "environment code"). However, I stopped it in 2 days for some reasons, one of them is that I realized that what I created are not lives, and I started to be faced with a paradox: _Are lives (plants or animals) their structures or their behaviors?_  However, I still think the idea interesting.  

Want to see the code of this small project?[clik here](https://github.com/xuyongyue/Evolution) . If you have interesting ideas about it, or if you are willing to cooperate with me to develop it, just contact me!<kbd>xyywd123@163.com</kbd>
