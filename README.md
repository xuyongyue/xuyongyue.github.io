## Welcome to Xu's Pages  
## Introduce: 
This is an uncompleted project.
>    Have you ever dreamt of creating lives on your computer? I tried a few months ago, not for paper, using my favorite programing language C. I built a  matrix, and let a kind of "grass" grow and multiply in it. The grass can produce seeds and the seeds will be spread every generation. The grass has its age, height and other features, which can be recorded in "genes". and there are interactions between them. What's the most important is that the genes have mutations. I wanted to see if they can develope to new "species" and how the population changes, and how the interations between "genes" change. I started from just one type of "grass" and some basic features and I planned a huge project, which includes various animals, plants, types of "genes" as well as notions such as " hybridize" and "adaptation"(Measured according to the similarity between "DNA" and "environment code"). However, I stopped it in 2 days for some reasons, one of them is that I realized that what I created are not lives, and I started to be faced with a paradox: _Are lives (plants or animals) their structures or their behaviors?_  However, I still think the idea interesting.
